# X_to_Y_Prediction
A cute project to predict a Y value based on an X value. Works best with Linear relationships. This is by far the easiest project you can try out in order to get into machine learning as it doesn't make use of any fancy optimizing functions, and only uses one weight. Not even a bias is used. Everything is easy to understand just by reading except for the backward function here: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.backward.html

Need Pytorch, matplotlib in order for this to work. GPU isn't needed nor used. Use CPU and just do it!
